A deep learning model is a network of weights whose values are optimized using a loss function during the training progress.
The weights of the network are typically initialized randomly before the start of the training process.
# In transfer learning:
we use a pre-trained model that has been trained on a related task(ResNet). This gives us a set of initial weights that are likely to perform better than the randomly initialized weights.
We optimize the pre-trained weights further for our specific task.
